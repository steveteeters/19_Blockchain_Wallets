## Objectives
- ### In this Challenge, I will complete the code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.
- ### To complete this Challenge, I will use two Python files named *crypto_wallet.py* and *fintech_finder.py*.
- ### I will use *Ganache* to create accounts, a **MNEMONIC** file, and test the validity of the transactions.

- ### [x] Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

- ### [x] Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

- ### [x] Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

## **Note: Please see files *crypto_wallet.py* and *fintech_finder.py* for specific coding.**
